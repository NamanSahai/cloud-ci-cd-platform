# CI/CD Pipeline using Jenkins and Docker

## Overview
This project implements a real-world Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline where every code push to GitHub automatically triggers a Jenkins build that creates, versions, and publishes a Docker image to Docker Hub.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical CI/CD fundamentals such as pipeline automation, Docker image lifecycle management, and secure credential handling using industry-standard tools.

---

## Tech Stack
- Jenkins – CI orchestration
- Docker – Containerization and image versioning
- GitHub – Source control and webhook triggers
- Docker Hub – Container image registry
- Linux (Ubuntu)

---

## CI/CD Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to the GitHub repository
2. GitHub webhook automatically triggers the Jenkins pipeline
3. Jenkins performs the following steps:
   - Clones the repository
   - Builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile
   - Tags the image with the Jenkins build number and `latest`
   - Pushes the image securely to Docker Hub
4. The pipeline completes without any manual intervention

This setup ensures consistent, repeatable builds for every commit.

---

## Jenkins Pipeline
The CI pipeline is defined entirely using a Jenkinsfile (Pipeline-as-Code), following best practices:
- Declarative pipeline syntax
- Clear and modular build stages
- Secure handling of Docker Hub credentials using Jenkins credentials store
- Automatic image versioning using build numbers

---

## Docker Image
The Docker image generated by the pipeline is publicly available on Docker Hub:

Docker Hub Repository:  
https://hub.docker.com/r/namansahai/cloud-ci-demo

Image tags include:
- `latest`
- Jenkins build number tags (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.)

---

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Practical CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Jenkins automation using GitHub webhooks
- Docker image build, tagging, and publishing workflow
- Secure credential management in CI pipelines
- Production-style CI design principles

---

## Future Enhancements
- Automated deployment using Kubernetes
- Helm-based release management
- Multi-environment pipelines (dev/staging/production)
